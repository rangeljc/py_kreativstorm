    Define an Employee class using dataclasses with attributes like name, age, department, and salary.

    Create an empty list to store employee objects.

    Add employees to the system by creating instances of the Employee class and adding them to the list.

    Display the details of all employees in the system.

    Allow for updating employee details, such as salary, by searching for an employee by name.

    Provide the functionality to remove an employee from the system by searching for them by name.

    Display the updated details of the remaining employees.

Note: You can expand the project by adding search or sorting functionality, or by storing the employee data in a database or file.
